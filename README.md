# Interantional Space Station - Tracker and Notifier 


#### The ISS is pretty cool, check out it's history [here!](https://www.issnationallab.org/about/iss-timeline/#:~:text=The%20first%20rudimentary%20station%20was,ever%20developed%3A%20the%20American%20shuttles.)

Well this python script tracks the ISS in the sky and notifies you when it will pass on top of you. It shows you a map with your position and the position of the ISS) and it adds events in your iCalendar for when it will pass.

> Space Station is only visible when it’s illuminated by sunlight. During the day, the sky is too bright to see it and as we look up late at night, ISS flies through Earth’s shadow so there’s no sunlight falling on the station for us to see it. There are two daily time windows when the station is visible: morning and evening twilight – the period just before sunrise and the period just after sunset. This when the background sky is dark enough but ISS is still catching enough light from the sun for us to see it. [SOURCE](https://www.fi.edu/blog/Seeing-International-Space-Station%21)

I think this is a cool thing to have. This is a work in progress.
